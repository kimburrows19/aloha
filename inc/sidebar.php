						<p>&ldquo;Very professional, fast and 
						thorough. I needed my carpet 
						cleaned ASAP. Aloha Carpet 
						was in and out within 24 hours. 
						The cleaner was friendly and 
						even helped moving some 
						furniture. No chemical smell 
						and now my carpet looks 
						great. I would use Aloha again.&ldquo;

						<p>&ldquo;I was dog sitting, the dog was sick and made a huge poop accident on my carpet. I learned about 							Aloha Carpet Care through a friend and called them up. They arrived fast and worked promptly to get the job 						done. I was amazed at how ALL the stain was removed; the stain and the horrible oder was entirely gone! I will 						definitely use them again!&ldquo;

						<p>&ldquo;We recently moved from Las Vegas and needed someone to clean our carpeting, area rugs, and upholstery.  I called Aloha Carpet Care after checking out the website.  I called and got an estimate and was able to have our carpets cleaned in 24 hours. They were extremely courteous and did a fantastic job. They even followed up with a phone call the next day to see if the carpet was dry and to our satisfaction. I would recommend Aloha Carpet Care to everyone and look forward to seeing them again in the future.   Thank you again&ldquo;

						<p>&ldquo;I am a loyal customer of Aloha Carpet Care, they are very reliable and their prices are great.  I like that when they are done with my carpet, it is not sopping wet and dries quickly. I have found my professional cleaning service of choice and don&rsquo;t need to look anywhere else.&ldquo;

						<p>&ldquo;Not only does my carpet look great, but it dried up so fast. I also notice that I&rsquo;m sneezing less now that they cleaned out my eight air ducts. There was so much cat hair in there it was embarrassing what they pulled out. Thanks Aloha for your great service.&ldquo;</p>

						<p>&ldquo;I was very happy to come home to a house with clean carpet.  I am so glad I chose Aloha over any of the other cheap, mis-leading ads.  I highly recommend this company and the professionalism they offer. Thanks for making my home look and smell fantastic.&ldquo;</p>

						<p>&ldquo;I chose Aloha Carpet Care because they are a small family owned company and I like to support small businesses; especially in this economy. I am glad that I gave them a chance because they were polite, professional and they did a fantastic job on my carpet.  &ldquo;</p>

						<p>&ldquo;I had Aloha come to my house to clean my living room, den and a couple of bedrooms. The gentleman who came out was Creeland. He was fast but thorough and did an excellent job with my carpet. He even vacuumed my carpet before he started the steam cleaning.  I will definitely use them again. &ldquo;</p>
